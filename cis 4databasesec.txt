PRACTICAL NO:4
Aim: To implement Database Security: Fragmentation
1. Open Net Configuration Assistant. Click on yes to launch the executable file.
2. Select Local Net Service Name Configuration option and click on Next.
3. Select Add and click on Next.
4. Enter service name as ‘mscit’ click on Next.
5. Select TCP and click on Next.
6. Give Hostname as ‘itprojector’ and click on Next.
7. Now click on Next to continue with the default selected options until finish
option is available.
8. Net Service configuration is created. Click on Next.
9. Click on Finish.
11. Open sqlplus and provide following credentials.
Username: system
Password: orcl
Host string: empty(leave it default)
12. Once connected enter node 1 for reference that this sql plus window is of
node1.
13. Open sqlplus and provide following credentials.
Username: student51 (student42,32,48,can also be used)
Password: student51 (same password as username)
Host string: mscit (service name entered earlier)
12. Once connected enter node 2 for reference that this sql plus window is of
node2.
a)Vertical Fragmentation
Vertical Fragmentation: Horizontal fragmentation and vertical fragmentation are
used to create the fragments of the tables. Vertical fragmentation – In vertical fragmentation, we
use the attributes (column ) to divide the database into fragments.
At node1:

create table empglobe(eno number(10),name varchar2(50),address varchar2(100),email
varchar2(25),sal number(15,2));

create table empnode1(eno number(10),name varchar2(50),address varchar2(100));

create database link link1 connect to student51 identified by &quot;student51&quot; using &#39;mscit&#39;;

select * from empnode2@link1;

create or replace trigger verticalFragment
after insert
on empglobe
for each row
begin
insert into empnode1 values(:new.eno,:new.name,:new.address);

insert into empnode2@link1 values(:new.eno,:new.email,:new.sal);

end;
